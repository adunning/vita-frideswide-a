*The life of St Frithuswith the virgin begins.*

### 1 <!-- Frithuswith's birth -->

^2^After the English people had been taught and baptized by the preaching of blessed Augustine, priests and deacons were then appointed, and churches were built and dedicated throughout that entire area. Then 'great numbers of believers were added',^[Acts 5.14] and throughout the whole land of the English a new Church was fruitful with offspring.

Moreover, a long time after, there was a certain king of Oxford whose name was Didan. He took a wife named Sefrida, [these names are Latinizations of Dæda, Dida, or Dydda and Sæthryth: @blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987, pp. 82–83] who worshipped God and was wise in every good work. And when they were together delighting in the flower of their youth, the Lord gave them fruitfulness. So the venerable Sefrida conceived, and after completing the suitable time, she gave birth to a daughter. When the aforementioned king heard this, 'he was overjoyed'^[Luke 23.8; 2 John 4; 3 John 3] and ordered her to be born again from water and the Holy Spirit.

### 2 <!-- Frithuswith becomes a nun -->

So the girl was baptized and they called her Frithuswith.

^3^This king's daughter was then nurtured attentively. And so, after five years had passed, they entrusted her to a certain matron named Ælfgiva [Ælfgifu: @blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987, p. 82] to be educated in letters. The virgin, therefore, whom God had already foreseen would become a vessel of the Holy Spirit, so set her mind to learning letters that within six months she knew the whole psalter.

The blessed virgin Frithuswith therefore 'developed and grew',^[1 Sam. 2.26, 1 Chron. 11.10; cf. Luke 2.52] and she strove with all her heart to 'make herself beloved'^[Sir. 20.13] by all, and as much as she could she was always devoted to the thresholds of the holy Church. She also stored up the words of holy Scriptures in the chamber of her breast, often repeating this prayer: that she 'might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of her life, and that she might see his will'^[Ps. 27.4 (Vulg. 26.4)] and fulfil it.

^4^Her aforementioned mother was then held back by bodily sickness, seized by a heavy fever, and died. But King Didan built a church and caused it to be dedicated in the city of Oxford in honour of the Holy Trinity, and of the chaste Virgin Mary, and of all the saints. [@blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987, p. 89 suggests that these might have been three separate churches] The venerable Frithuswith then asked her father, namely King Didan, to give her the church. The king therefore gave her the church.

And so the devout virgin, after her mother's death, strove to serve God, always attending to vigils and prayers day and night, so that she often forgot the food of the body, and longed alone for the food of souls. The virgin Frithuswith, viewing the transitory pomp and glory of this world, regarding it all 'like dung',^[Job 20.7] gave whatever she could obtain to the poor. She always wore a hair shirt; she had a little barley bread with a few green vegetables and water for food. Meanwhile, all the English people marvelled at such strength at a young age, and the king rejoiced when he considered and knew that his only daughter was a vessel of the Holy Spirit.

^5^The blessed virgin then begged her father, saying, 'O sweetest father, grant that I may deserve to attain the habit of a nun, and in the temple of God always to praise and bless his name.'^[Cf. Luke 24.53.]

Now King Didan, hearing his daughter's plan, 'was overjoyed'.^[Luke 23.8; 2 John 4; 3 John 3] And calling upon a certain religious man named Orgar, bishop of Lincoln, he caused his daughter Frithuswith to be consecrated to God. Twelve virgins were consecrated with her, all of noble descent. Then the king caused houses to be built that were appropriate for nuns, namely a refectory and dormitory and cloisters, and he gave religious men to serve them.^[*Viri religiosi* are usually men who live according to a monastic rule. This has been interpreted to mean that Frideswide's was a double monastery.]<!-- TODO: cite Blair? --> King Didan also gave the properties and estates of St Mary, and a third part of the city of Oxford, as the nuns' provision.

### 3 <!-- King Didan dies -->

^6^Blessed Frithuswith, adorned with good customs, devoted herself to tame the body and give life to the spirit,^[Cf. Is. 57.15, 1 Cor. 15.45.] according to the voice of the Apostle, saying, 'Mortify your members which are upon the earth.'^[Col. 3.5]

But not long after, King Didan 'sunk to his bed',^[1 Macc. 1.6, 6.8] seized by a heavy illness. Having distributed his treasure to the poor, made fast by the communion of the body of Christ, he gave up his spirit to God.

Blessed Frithuswith, therefore, a bride of Christ, deprived of both her parents, entrusted what she was fearing more and more to the Holy Spirit. The blessed virgin also resolved in her heart that she would bend her knees a hundred times a day and a hundred times a night, afflicting her flesh, and asking for God's mercy.

### 4 <!-- The temptation of Frithuswith -->

^7^One night, then, while she was carrying this out alone in the oratory she had built for herself, while her companions were asleep, the Devil appeared adorned with gold and silver and every precious stone, and attended by a company of demons; he said to her, 'O my beloved virgin, now is the time for you to receive the 'reward of your labours'.^[Wisd. 10.17] Come therefore to 'worship me',^[Matt. 4.9; Luke 4.7] for I am Christ, and I will give you the crown of immortality which you have earned.'

Blessed Frithuswith said to him, 'O wretched and most loathsome of all creatures, why do you not fear the judgement of God? For the day will come when both you and your master will receive eternal punishment. How therefore can you promise what you do not have?'

Saying this, the venerable virgin marked herself with the sign of the cross, and immediately the Devil, roaring and howling, disappeared. But the blessed virgin's mind was calm, persevering in prayer and remaining in vigils.

### 5 <!-- King Algar seeks out Frithuswith -->

^8^A certain king of Leicester named Algar, a most wicked man and hateful to God, succeeded to the kingdom after the death of King Didan. He sent envoys to blessed Frithuswith, thus saying, 'King Algar has sent us to you, virgin Frithuswith, desiring to have you in marriage. If you do not wish this, he will cause you to be dragged to a brothel.'

The virgin consecrated to God answered them, 'I am betrothed to Christ, the king of all kings, and therefore it seems to offend against moral law that, leaving the king, I should obey the orders of a servant. As to what you say of drawing me to brothel, you must know that character cannot be contaminated except by the consent of the mind. But above all, "the Lord is my helper; I will not fear what man may do to me."'^[Ps. 118.6 (Vulg. 117.6); Heb. 13.6]

^9^The king's ministers therefore indignantly said, 'Unless you willingly accept the king's command, we will seize you and take you to King Algar, whether you wish it or not.'

Hearing this, blessed Frithuswith, looking up on high, said with a loud voice, '"Arise, Lord, let not man take comfort; let the nations be judged in your sight, and let them know that they are but men."^[Ps. 9.19–20 (Vulg. 9.20–21)] "Take hold of shield and buckler and arise for my help; say to my soul, 'I am your salvation'."'^[Ps. 35.2–3 (Vulg. 34.2–3)]

When the holy virgin had said these things, their eyes were blinded, and they could not see the 'light of heaven'.^[Tob. 5.12, 11.8, 12.3] But when the people of the city of Oxford saw this, they fell down in terror at the feet of the holy virgin, begging her to pray for them.

^10^Then the most holy woman began to pray on bended knees, saying, 'Invisible and changeless God, "who made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them";^[Exod. 20.11; Ps. 146.6 (Vulg. 145.6); Acts 4.24] and who "formed Adam from the mud of the earth";^[Gen. 2.7; Tob. 8.8] and through the death of your son Jesus Christ our Lord redeemed him who was led astray by the Devil's jealousy and thrown out from the loveliness of paradise: restore the eyes' light to these wretches, that this people may know "you are merciful and compassionate, long-suffering and of great mercy and true",^[Ps. 86.15 (Vulg. 85.15)] who lives and reigns throughout endless ages of ages.'

And when they had all answered 'Amen', their eyes were restored, and running forth to the blessed virgin's feet, they praised the Lord, magnifying his infinite mercy. ^11^And when they came to King Algar, they related all the events of the matter.

And so the king, 'filled with fury and anger',^[Dan. 2.12, 3.13, 3.19.] said, 'Neither her incantations, nor her false doctrines, nor her magic art will free her from my hands, but I will have her.'

In the very night as blessed Frithuswith was praying, 'an angel of the Lord appeared to her, saying', 'O "chosen vessel"^[Acts 9.15] of the Holy Spirit, "do not fear"^[Matt. 1.20] the threats of the cruel king, because Jesus Christ "will hide you under the shadow of his wings",^[Ps. 17.8 (Vulg. 16.8)] and "he will lift you up"^[Is. 22.17] with his right hand. Making your way to the river, then, take with you whichever nuns you wish as your companions, and you will find a boat made ready by God and a sailor; and when you board the boat, the Almighty "will lead you forth by the right way"^[Ps. 107.7 (Vulg. 106.7)] to glorify his name.' After she heard this, he withdrew from her.

^12^The blessed virgin then rose and called two virgin nuns consecrated to God with her, and when they reached the bank of the Thames according to the angel's command, they found a little boat, [this term can refer figuratively to the Church as St Peter's ship: @ashdowneDictionaryMedievalLatin2018, s.v. 'navicula'] and seated there a young man shining with 'the countenance of an angel',^[Judges 13.6] who thus addressed the virgins, 'Enter into the boat, consecrated virgins.'

Having therefore entered into the boat, they came in the space of one hour to a village called Bampton, led by the Lord. And as they were getting out of the boat, the young man suddenly disappeared from their eyes.

Fearing the wicked king's snares, blessed Frithuswith then went with her virgins into a certain wood called Binsey, not far from the aforesaid village; and there they found a path that led to a little house which swineherds had once made, tending droves of pigs; and it was completely covered with ivy. The most holy virgin entered it with her virgins, protecting herself with the sign of the holy cross.

^13^And so the ungodly king arose with his retinue and reached the city of Oxford, desiring to violate the vessels consecrated to God.

From the moment that the king then began to enter the city, his eyes were blinded, and he could not see. From this it is believed to have come about that kings do not enter Oxford. And so the ungodly king remained blind all the days of his life, and he was always plotting and thinking how he could harm blessed Frithuswith.

But the blessed virgin of Christ always bore the voice of the Gospel in her breast, and she did not cease day or night^[Cf. Acts 20.31.] from divine conversation and prayer. The venerable virgin accordingly remained in that very wood for close to three years.

### 6 <!-- Sight restored to a girl in Bampton -->

^14^There was a certain girl in the aforesaid village of Bampton who had been blinded by the Devil almost seven years before. While she was sleeping one night, someone appeared to her in her dreams, saying, 'Go into the wood where the nuns live, and take a droplet that will have fallen from the hands of blessed Frithuswith when she has washed her hands, and anoint your eyes, and you will receive your sight.'

In the morning the girl told her father what she had seen. Indeed her father, holding her hand, led her with him until he came to the virgin's dwelling. And awaiting the hour when blessed Frithuswith had washed her hands, he anointed his daughter's eyes with the water he received, and she immediately recovered her sight.

Therefore, blessing God, they returned home, praising the Saviour's omnipotence, telling the marvellous things they had seen done through holy Frithuswith.

### 7 <!-- Alward of Seacourt's hand is healed -->

^16^There was also a certain young man named Alward in a village called Seacourt [linked to the well at Binsey: @biddleDesertedMedievalVillage1961] who was felling trees with an axe on a Sunday, thinking little of the day of the Lord's Resurrection. While he was doing this, his hands stuck to the haft, so that he could not stretch out his fingers at all; but crying out with a loud voice, he was saying to himself that his hand had been set on fire.

He was led all the way to the holy virgin, and rushing to her feet, began to beg for her help.

As she was filled with pity in her innermost parts and moved with compassion, she began to ask the Lord's mercy on bended knees, thus saying, 'Adonai, Lord God, great and marvellous, who appeared to Moses "in a flame of fire in a bush",^[Acts 7.30] and gave him the law on Sinai, and led the children of Israel "out from the land of Egypt",^[Acts 7.40] and made them to cross through the midst of the Red Sea on a dry path, and brought the prophet Jonah from the belly of a whale unharmed and safe, and willed your son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to be incarnated for the redemption of the world: I ask through your invocation to restore this man to his former health, for you are the blessed God, the Saviour of all who hope in you, remaining in the ages of ages.'

And when those standing near had answered 'Amen', the virgin, making the sign of the cross and holding the young man's hand, drove out the pain and freed him.

And returning home, he glorified God. Therefore, to the Lord's praise, the name of blessed Frithuswith was spread throughout that whole area.

### 8 <!-- A fisherman freed from a demon -->

^17^It also happened that fishermen were climbing into a boat one night to catch fish, as is the custom of that kind of people. When therefore they had placed their nets into the boat and fallen asleep on board, one of them was seized by a demon, and he began to give a false laugh; and holding one of his colleagues, he was suffocating him with his hands and meant to tear him apart with his teeth. But the others, taking hold of him, tied his hands behind his back, leading him to the blessed virgin's oratory.

The venerable virgin, seeing the image of God ridiculed by the Devil, then entreated God on bended knees, the Father Almighty and his Son our Lord, that through the power of the Holy Spirit he might free his creation struck down by the enemy of the human race. Saying this, she made the sign of the holy cross on his forehead, thus saying: 'Depart, Satan, from the image that God formed in his own likeness.'^[Cf. Gen. 1.26–27, 2.7, 5.1]

When she had said this, he became as if dead and fell to the earth. The blessed virgin ordered him to be released. And when he was freed, she held his hand and said, '"In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise"^[Acts 3.6] in good health.'

And healthy indeed, he arose and began to glorify God, who had delivered him through the virtues of holy Frithuswith. Now his name was Leowin.

^18^The Lord wrought these and many other miracles through blessed Frithuswith.

### 9 <!-- Frithuswith returns to Oxford, heals a leper with a kiss, and dies -->

Then one day, she said to her companions, 'Let us return to our convent.'

Therefore, after they had made the little boat ready, the blessed virgins entered it; and coming to the city of Oxford, they were received with honour by the citizens and all the clergy.

But while blessed Frithuswith was entering the aforesaid city, a certain young man full of leprosy met her, and said to her, 'I entreat you, O virgin Frithuswith, to give me a kiss in the name of Jesus Christ.'

Filled as as she always was with the Holy Spirit, making the sign of the cross, she gave a kiss in the name of the Lord, and he was at once cleansed from the leprosy. And the people of that city and all the clergy, seeing the powers and miracles wrought through holy Frithuswith, rejoiced at her coming.

^19^And so, the blessed virgin of Christ did not cease to serve almighty God, and she afflicted the body to give life to the spirit.

On the fourth ides of October^[Sunday, 12 October 727] an angel of the Lord appeared to her and said, 'The fourteenth calends of November will be a Sunday,^[19 October 727] and you will receive the crown of immortality from the Lord which you have always desired. For a heavenly hall has been made ready for you, and light everlasting, because you despised the earthly palace of your father.' Having said this, the angel withdrew from her.

Therefore, the most blessed virgin Frithuswith, seized with a severe fever, afflicted by bodily illness, began to be weakened in all parts of her body. Every day therefore all the citizens of that city came to her. But the blessed virgin did not cease to restore them with sound advice.

^20^Then on the Saturday when she was to pass from her body on the morrow, she asked for a grave to be opened for her in the church of Mary, the blessed mother of God, saying, 'Tomorrow will be Sunday, and I do not wish anyone to work because of me. For this night after the third cockcrow, fortified by the body and blood of Christ, I will go to my Lord. For "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course of righteousness", I have despised the world and all its pride, and therefore "there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness".'^[2 Tim. 4.7–8]

Saying this, as the discomfort of her illness worsened, she directed that the Eucharist of Christ be brought to her. Receiving it joyfully, she began to bless almighty God.

^21^And when she was overwhelmed by the huge weight of her weakness, just as she had foretold, after many teachings, she looked up on high and said with a loud voice, 'Welcome, holy virgins; you are welcome.'

And those standing near asked her with whom she was speaking.

But she answered, 'Do you not see the blessed virgins of God, Catherine and Cecilia?'

And when she spoke to them again, she said to all those listening, 'Now I will come, my ladies.'

And so, after the third cockcrow, just as she had foretold, saying farewell to everyone, she passed to the Lord Jesus Christ. At that hour such a light shone through the whole city of Oxford, and there was such 'a sweet-smelling savour'^[Eph. 5.2] for a space of three hours, that all marvelled and glorified God.

^22^A certain man also, struck down by a paralytic disease -- an intensely rich man -- ordered his servants to carry him to the holy virgin's tomb. And when they had carried him all the way to the tomb, he received good health at once by the virtues of holy Frithuswith; and he who had been unable to speak and lame for two years, and had been carried about by others' hands, returned home on his own feet, praising God.

### 10 <!-- Athelwold walks at Frithuswith's burial -->

^23^Another certain nobleman named Athelwold, who was crippled from the navel downwards, came to the doors of the church when they were burying the body of blessed Frithuswith, dragging his body with two crutches.

He therefore wished to enter the church, but could not do so because of the great number of people. But he began to cry out at the church's doors, 'O chosen bride of Christ, virgin Frithuswith, free me from my infirmities, for I know that you can help me if you wish.'

As he said this, he was made so healthy that it was as if he had never received any illness. And so, rising and bursting forth, and 'leaping like a hart',^[Is. 35.6] he manfully entered the church, carrying with uplifted hands the supports with which he used to drag his body, praising God, the redeemer of all.

^24^The blessed virgin Frithuswith therefore passed to the Lord on the fourteenth calends of November, in the year 727 from the Lord's Incarnation.^[Sunday, 19 October 727] And she was buried in the church of St Mary, on the south side, where many miracles are performed because of her virtues by our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit, throughout all the ages of ages. Amen.
