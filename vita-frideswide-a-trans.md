*Here begins the life of St Frideswide the virgin.*

# Frideswide's birth

\[2\] Therefore, after the English people were taught by the preaching of blessed Augustine and baptized, priests and deacons were appointed, and churches were built and dedicated through that entire area. Then *great numbers of believers were added*,^[Acts 5.14] and through the whole land of the English a new church was made fruitful with offspring.<!-- chk --> After a long time, moreover, there was a certain king of Oxford whose name was Didan. He took a wife named Sefrida, honouring God and wise in every good work. And since they rejoiced together in the flower of youth, the Lord gave them fruitfulness. Accordingly, the venerable Sefrida conceived, and after completing the suitable time, she gave birth to a daughter. When the aforementioned king had heard this, *he was overjoyed*^[Luke 23.8; 2 John 4; 3 John 3] and directed her to be born again from water and the Holy Spirit.

# Frideswide becomes a nun

They named the baptized girl Frideswide. \[3\] As the daughter of a king, she was nurtured attentively. And so, when five years had passed, they entrusted her to a certain matron named Ælfgifu to learn letters. The virgin, whom God had now foreseen would be a vessel of the Holy Spirit, so fixed her mind to learning letters that within six months she would know the whole psalter. The blessed virgin Frideswide therefore *became greater and greater*,^[1 Chron. 11.9] and her whole mind was shining to *make herself beloved*^[Sir. 20.13] by everyone, and as much as she could she was always devoted to the thresholds of the holy church. She also stored up the words of Holy Scripture in the chamber of her breast, often repeating this prayer: that she *might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of her life, and that she might see his will*^[Ps. 27.4 (Vulg. 26.4)] and fulfil it.

\[4\] Her aforesaid mother then died, held by sickness of body and seized by a heavy fever. But King Didan built a church and made it to be dedicated in the city of Oxford in honour of the Holy Trinity, the chaste Virgin Mary, and all the saints. Then the venerable Frideswide asked her father -- King Didan that is to say -- to build her a church. The king therefore gave her a church.

The devout virgin thus devoted herself to serving God after her mother's death, always applying herself to vigils and prayers day and night, so that she often forgot bodily food, and she desired the food of souls with her whole endeavour. The virgin Frideswide, viewing the pride and glory of this transitory world, considering it all *as if it were dung*,^[Job 20.7] gave whatever she could obtain to the poor. She always used sackcloth; she had a small portion of barley bread with a few green vegetables and water for her food. All the English people meanwhile wondered at such strength at a young age, and the king rejoiced, thinking and knowing that his only daughter was the chosen vessel of the Holy Spirit.

\[5\] The blessed virgin therefore asked her father, saying, 'O sweetest father, grant that I may deserve to attain the habit of a nun, and to praise and bless God's name always in his temple.'

King Didan, hearing his daughter's plan, *was overjoyed*.^[Luke 23.8; 2 John 4; 3 John 3] Summoning a certain devout man named Orgar, bishop of Lincoln, he caused his daughter Frideswide to be consecrated to God. Twelve virgins were made holy with her, all of noble birth. And so, the aforesaid king caused houses to be built that were appropriate for nuns, namely a refectory and dormitory and cloisters, and he gave devout men to serve them. King Didan also gave the properties and estates of St Mary, and a third part of the city of Oxford, as the nuns' provision.

# King Didan dies

\[6\] Blessed Frideswide, adorned with good customs, devoted herself to tame the body and give life to the spirit, according to the Apostle's voice, saying, *Put to death the parts of your body which are on the earth.*^[Col. 3.5]

But not long after, King Didan *sunk to his bed*,^[1 Macc. 1.6, 6.8] seized by a heavy illness. Dividing his treasure among the poor, protected by the communion of the body of Christ, he gave back his spirit to God.

And so blessed Frideswide, a bride of Christ, deprived of both her parents, entrusted herself more and more to the Holy Spirit whom she feared. The blessed virgin also resolved in her heart that she would bend her knees a hundred times per day and a hundred times every night, striking her flesh and asking for the mercy of God.

# The temptation of Frideswide

\[7\] One night, therefore, while she was spending time alone in the room for prayer which had been built for her, while her companions were sleeping, a devil appeared to her, adorned with gold and silver and every precious stone, and attended by a company of demons. He said to her, 'O my beloved virgin, now is the time for you to receive the reward of your labours. Come therefore to *worship me*,^[Matt. 4.9] for I am Christ, and I give you the crown of immortality which you have deserved.'

Blessed Frideswide said to him, 'O wretched and most loathsome of all creatures, why do you not fear the judgement of God? For the day will come when you and your master will receive eternal punishment. How therefore are you promising what you do not have?' 

Saying this, the venerable virgin marked herself with the sign of the cross, and immediately the devil disappeared, roaring and howling. But the blessed virgin's mind was calm, continuing in prayer and remaining in vigils.

# King Algar seeks to coerce Frideswide into marriage

\[8\] After the death of King Didan, the kingdom passed to a certain king of Leicester, a wicked man and hateful to God, named Algar. He sent envoys to blessed Frideswide, thus saying: 'The king has sent us to you, virgin Frideswide, wishing to have you in marriage. If you do not wish this, he will drag you to a brothel.' 

The virgin consecrated to God answered them, 'I am given in marriage to Christ, the king of all kings, and therefore this seems to offend against moral law, since in abandoning the king I would obey the orders of a servant. That however you say you will drag me to a brothel, know that it is not possible to pollute the mind except with the mind's agreement. But above all, *the Lord is my helper; I will not fear what man may do to me.*'^[Ps. 118.6 (Vulg. 117.6); Heb. 13.6] 

\[9\] The king's ministers indignantly said, 'Unless you willingly agree to the king's command, we will carry you off and bring you to King Algar, whether you wish it or not.'

Heading this, blessed Frideswide, looking up on high, said with a loud voice, '*Arise, Lord, let not man take comfort; let the nations be judged in your sight, and let them know that they are but men.*^[Ps. 9.19–20 (Vulg. 9.20–21)] *Take hold of shield and buckler and arise for my help. Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."*'^[Ps. 35.2–3 (Vulg. 34.2–3)]

When the holy virgin had said this, their eyes were blinded, and they could not see the *light of heaven*.^[Tob. 5.12, 11.8, 12.3] But the people of the city of Oxford, seeing this, fell down terrified at the holy virgin's feet, asking her to pray for them.

\[10\] The most holy woman therefore began to pray on bended knees, saying, 'Invisible and changeless God, *who made heaven and earth, the seas and all that is in them*;^[Exod. 20.11; Ps. 146.6 (Vulg. 145.6); Acts 4.24] and who *formed Adam from the mud of the earth*;^[Gen. 2.7; Tob. 8.8] and through the death of your son Jesus Christ our Lord redeemed him who was led astray by the Devil's jealousy and thrown out from the loveliness of paradise: restore the eyes' light to these wretches, that this people may know that *you are merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and plenteous in goodness and truth*,^[Ps. 86.15 (Vulg. 85.15)] for you live and reign unto ages of ages.'

And when they all had answered 'Amen', their eyes were restored, and running forth to the blessed virgin's feet, they praised the Lord, magnifying his infinite mercy. \[11\] And coming to King Algar, they told the whole outcome of the matter.

And so *the king, filled with rage and anger*,^[Conflation of Dan. 2.12, 3.13, 3.19] said, 'Neither her spells nor her false doctrines nor her magic art will free her from my hands, but I will have her.'

In the very night, as blessed Frideswide was praying, *an angel of the Lord appeared to her, saying,* 'O *chosen vessel*^[Acts 9.15] of the Holy Spirit, *do not fear*^[Matt. 1.20] the deadly<!--also means dead/null; is there a way to get in both?--> threats of the king, because Jesus Christ *will hide you under the shadow of his wings*,^[Ps. 17.8 (Vulg. 16.8)] and *he will lift you up*^[Is. 22.17] with his right hand. Making your way to the river, then, take with you whichever fellow<!-- chk --> nuns you wish, and you will find a ship and a sailor made ready by God. When you board the ship, the omnipotent Lord *will lead you forth by the right way*^[Ps. 107.7 (Vulg. 106.7)] to glorify his name.' After she heard this, he went away from her.

\[12\] The blessed virgin then rose and called two virgin nuns consecrated to God with her, and they reached the bank of the Thames, following the angel's instruction. They found a little ship, [this often figuratively refers to the Church as St Peter's ship: @ashdowne:2018dictionary, s.v. 'navicula'] and a seated youth shining with *the countenance of an angel*,^[Judges 13.6] who addressed the virgins: 'Enter the ship, consecrated virgins.'

And so, getting into the ship, they came in the space of one hour to a village called Bampton, led by the Lord. As they came out of the ship, the youth suddenly disappeared from their eyes.

Blessed Frideswide with her virgins, fearing the  wicked king's treachery, entered a certain wood called Binsey, not far from the town mentioned above. They found a path there that led to a little house which swineherds had once made, tending flocks of pigs, and it was completely covered with ivy. The most holy virgin entered it with her virgins, arming herself with the sign of the cross.

\[13\] And so the king, rising with his retinue, reached the city of Oxford, desiring to violate the vessel consecrated to God. From the moment that the king began to enter the city, all their eyes were blinded, and they could not see. From that, it is believed to have come about that kings do not enter Oxford. The wicked king thus remained blind all the days of his life: he was always plotting and thinking how he could harm blessed Frideswide.

But the blessed virgin always bore the Gospel's voice in her breast, and she did not cease day or night from divine conversation and prayer. The venerable virgin therefore remained in that wood for close to three years.

# Sight restored to a girl in Bampton

\[14\] There was a certain girl in the aforementioned village of Bampton who had been blinded by a devil almost seven years before. While she slept one night, someone appeared to her in her dreams, saying, 'Go into the wood where the nuns live, and take a drop of liquid that falls from the hands of blessed Frideswide when she washes her hands. Anoint your eyes, and you will receive your sight.'

In the morning, the girl told her father what she had seen. The father, holding her hand, led her along with him until he had come to the virgin's dwelling place. And, awaiting the hour when blessed Frideswide had washed her hands, receiving the water, he anointed the eyes of his daughter, and she immediately received her sight. Therefore, blessing God, they returned home, praising the Saviour's omnipotence, telling the marvellous things they had seen happen through the holy Frideswide.

# Alward of Seacourt's hand is healed

\[16\] There was also a young man named Alward in a village called Seacourt who was felling trees with an axe on a Sunday, thinking little of the day of the Lord's Resurrection. While he was doing this, his hand stuck to his handle, so that he could not stretch out his fingers at all. Shouting with a loud voice, he said that his hand was burning itself. Led all the way to the blessed virgin, he rushed to her feet and began to beg for her help.

As she was filled with pity in her innermost parts and moved by compassion, she began to ask the Lord's mercy on bended knees, saying, 'Lord God almighty, great and marvellous, who *appeared* to Moses *in a flame of fire in a bush*,^[Acts 7.30] and gave the law to him on Sinai, and *led* the sons of Israel *out from the land of Egypt*,^[Acts 7.40] and made them to cross through the midst of the Red Sea on a dry path, and who brought the prophet Jonah from the belly of a whale unharmed and safe, and wished your son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to become flesh for the world's redemption: I ask through calling on you to restore this man's original health, for you are the blessed God, the saviour of all who hope in you, continuing into the ages of ages.'

And when those standing round answered 'Amen', the virgin made the sign of the cross, and holding the young man's hand, she freed him when his pain fled. Returning home, he glorified God. Therefore, the name of blessed Frideswide was published through that whole area.

# A fisherman freed from a demon

\[17\] It also happened that fishermen were climbing into a ship one night to catch fish, as is the custom of that sort of people. When therefore they had placed nets into the ship and fallen asleep in it, one of them was seized by a devil. He began to give deceptive loud laughs. Holding one of his colleagues, he suffocated him with his hands, and he meant to tear him apart with his teeth. But the rest held him and bound his hands from the back, leading him to the blessed virgin's room for prayer.

The venerable virgin, seeing the image of God ridiculed by the devil, entreated God on bended knees, the omnipotent Father and his Son our Lord, that through the Holy Spirit's power he might free his creation, struck down by the enemy of humankind. Saying this, she made the sign of the holy Cross on his forehead, so speaking: 'Go away, Satan, from the image that God formed in his own likeness.'^[Cf. Gen. 1.26–27, 2.7, 5.1]

When she had said this, he was made as if dead and fell to the earth. The blessed virgin ordered him to be freed. And when he had been freed, she held his hand and said, '*In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise*^[Acts 3.6] unharmed.'

And he arose, healthy, and he began to glorify God, who freed him the holy Frideswide's virtues. Now his name was Leowin. \[18\] The Lord worked these and many other miracles through blessed Frideswide.

# Frideswide returns to Oxford, heals a leper with a kiss, and dies

One day, she said to her companions, 'Let us go back to our convent.' When they had made the ship ready, the blessed virgins entered it. Coming to the city of Oxford, the citizens and all the clergy received them reverently. But while blessed Frideswide was entering the city mentioned above, a certain youth, filled with leprosy, presented himself to her and said, 'I entreat you, O virgin Frideswide, to give me a kiss in the name of Jesus Christ.'

As she was always filled with the Holy Spirit, she made the sign of the Cross, gave him a kiss in the name of the Lord, and he was at once cleansed from the leprosy. All the people and clergy of that city saw what powers and miracles were occurring through the holy Frideswide, and they rejoiced in her arrival.

\[19\] And so, the blessed virgin of Christ did not cease to serve the omnipotent God, and she struck her body to give life to her spirit.

On the fourth ides of October^[Sunday, 12 October 727] an angel of the Lord appeared to her and said, 'The fourteenth calends of November will be a Sunday,^[19 October 727] and you will receive the crown of immortality from the Lord for which you have always longed. For a heavenly hall is made ready for you, and light everlasting, because you have despised the Father's earthly domain.' After he said this, the angel left her.

A very strong fever then seized the most blessed virgin Frideswide, afflicted by bodily illness, and she began to be weakened in all parts of her body. One day, all the citizens of that city came to her. But the blessed virgin, teaching them sound things,<!-- chk --> did not cease to restore them.

\[20\] On the Saturday evening before she was to pass away,<!-- chk --> she asked for a tomb to be opened for her in the church of the blessed mother of God, saying, 'Tomorrow will be Sunday, and I do not wish anyone to work because of me. For on this night, after the third cockcrow, fortified by the body and blood of Christ, I will go to my Lord. *I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race of righteousness,* I have rejected the world and all its pride, and therefore *there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness.*^[2 Tim. 4.7–8]

As she said this and the discomfort of the illness worsened, she directed that the Eucharist of Christ be brought to her. Receiving it joyfully, she began to bless the omnipotent God.

\[21\] And while the huge weight of the sickness was troubling her, just as she had foretold, after much teaching, she looked up on high and said with a loud voice, 'Welcome, holy virgins; you are welcome.'

And those standing round asked her with whom she was speaking.

But she answered, 'Do you not see Catherine and Cecilia, the blessed virgins of God?'

And when she spoke to them again, she said to all those listening, 'Now I will come, O my Lord.'

And so, after the third cockcrow, just as she had foretold, she said farewell to them all and passed to the Lord Jesus Christ. In that hour, such a light shone through the whole city of Oxford, and such sweetness of a smell was fragrant for a space of three hours, that everyone marvelled and glorified God.

\[22\] A certain paralysed man also struck down by a disease -- an intensely rich man -- directed his servants to bring him to the holy virgin's tomb. And when they had carried him all the way to the tomb, he received good health on the spot by the virtues of St Frideswide. He who had been unable to speak and lame, and had been carried about by others' hands, returned home on his own feet, praising God.

# Athelwold made able to walk at Frideswide's funeral

\[23\] There was another certain noble man named Athelwold who was crippled from the navel downwards. When they were burying the body of blessed Frideswide, he came to the church door, dragging his body with two crutches. He therefore wished to enter the church, but could not do so because of the great number of people. But he began to shout at the church's doors, 'O chosen bride of Christ, virgin Frideswide, free me from my illnesses, for I know that if you wish to help me, you can do so.'

As he said this, he was made clean, as if he had never carried any disease. And so, rising and bursting forth, and *leaping like a deer*,^[Is. 35.6] he manfully entered the church, carrying with uplifted hands the supports that he had used to drag his body.

\[24\] Blessed Frideswide therefore passed to the Lord on the fourteenth calends of November, in the year from the Lord's incarnation 727.^[Sunday, 19 October 727] And she was buried in the southern part of the church of St Mary, where many miracles happened because of her virtues from our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit, throughout all the ages of ages. Amen.
