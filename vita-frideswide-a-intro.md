# The Worcester Legendary: *Life of St Frideswide*

<!-- = Hardy 1005 -->

## Introduction

*The Life of St Frideswide the Virgin* (*BHL* 3164) is the oldest substantial account of Frideswide. John of Worcester (*fl.* 1095--1140) added the text to the Worcester Legendary, an eleventh-century collection of saints' lives, and this is the only surviving copy. John Blair designates it 'Life A', and the adaptation that he attributes to Robert of Cricklade as 'Life B' [@blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987, p. 93].

### Manuscript: London, British Library, Cotton MS Nero E. [i]{.smallcaps}/2

The complete Life A is known in only one manuscript: London, British Library, Cotton MS Nero E. [i]{.smallcaps}/2, fols 156r--157v (*N*), part of the 'Worcester Legendary', originally made at Worcester in the third quarter of the eleventh century [@kerCatalogueManuscriptsContaining1957, no. 29: the British Library replaced 'part 1' and 'part 2' notations in shelfmarks with '/1' and '/2' in 2017]. This is the oldest substantial collection of saints' lives from England, now spread across Cotton MS Nero E. [i]{.smallcaps}/1, Nero E. [i]{.smallcaps}/2, and Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 9. The contents have been rearranged over time and additions made to them. In their original form, the set consisted of two volumes, with the lives arranged from January through December [@jacksonContentsCottonCorpusLegendary1996].

The section containing the life of Frideswide is part of a set of additions from the second quarter of the twelfth century: in Nero E. [i]{.smallcaps}/1, fols 53v--54v; and in Nero E. [i]{.smallcaps}/2, fols 156--165 and 187--188, adding new folios to the volume:

Nero E. [i]{.smallcaps}/2, fols 187r--188v
: *Vita sancti Bede* (*BHL* 1069)

Patrick McGurk identifies the additions as being in the hand of John of Worcester (*fl.* 1095--1140). An inscription in his chronicle from Worcester Cathedral Priory (Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 157) identifies it as being his autograph. The same hand also appears in Dublin, Trinity College, MS 503; Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Auct. F. 1. 9; and Cambridge, University Library, MS Kk.4.6 [@darlingtonChronicleJohnWorcester1995, pp. 2:xix--xxix<!-- chk -->; @jacksonContentsCottonCorpusLegendary1996, pp. 144--145; @thomsonDescriptiveCatalogueMedieval2011, pp. 82--83 and plates 5 a--e]. They are not fragments from another book: Nero E. [i]{.smallcaps}/1, fols 53v--54v are an addition to originally blank pages from the eleventh century. A fragment of a pen trial on Nero E. [i]{.smallcaps}/2, fol. 165v, 'dei gratia Wigo', confirms that the pages were at Worcester [@blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987, p. 93]. Cotton and his associates have intervened in the contents after fol. 165: fols 181--84 were not in the volume when it was owned by John Joscelyn [@titeEarlyRecordsSir2003, p. 138].

Frideswide's life is divided in the manuscript into ten apparent chapters, designated through two- to three-line capitals in red. Apart from the opening rubric, there are no headings or other markers to indicate whether they reflected a liturgical purpose or intellectual scheme.

### Editorial method

The text is edited from the single complete manuscript. It was last edited by @blairSaintFrideswideReconsidered1987 [pp. 96–101], who aimed to understand the textual tradition through comparison with derivative versions produced up to the sixteenth century. These are:

- *BHL* 3166: an abbreviation of the text in the fourteenth-century Romsey Legendary in London, British Library, Lansdowne MS 436, fols 101r--103r (*L*)
- *BHL* 3167: a summary in a miscellany from the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century Oxford, Balliol College, MS 228, fol. 300r (*B*);
- extracts in the Hereford breviary, as edited from three sources (*H*: Hereford, Cathedral Library, MS P.9.vi; *W*: Worcester, Cathedral Library, MS Q.86; and *R*: the Rouen printing of 1505) [@frereHerefordBreviary1904, p. 2:376--377].

Blair concluded that *L* and *B* derive from a separate witness from the one for *N* and Life B, but these witnesses also simplify and amplify the text for oral delivery with less context.

By comparing the approach that the compiler of the Romsey Legendary (*L*) takes to adapting its source material across the collection, it becomes clear that her work (assuming it was a nun of Romsey) largely reproduces source material available in shrines at this period, but also that she freely adds rhetorical flourishes. This is also visible in her treatment of Prior Philip's *Miracula*. What Blair interpreted as words and phrases missing from *N* are thus better understood as interpolations. This prompts a presentation that adheres more closely to the text of *N* than Blair. This edition adopts readings from other manuscripts only where the sense demands them.

Blair created section numbers, reproduced here, to facilitate comparison between this life and Robert of Cricklade's.

Like Blair's, this edition presents the Worcester *Life* with minimal corrections. I created a new transcription of the text and collated the result with Blair's edition to reduce error. This brought to light a few minor misreadings of *N* in the previous edition. Blair's punctuation is based on the manuscript's, mostly changing any instance of a point or punctus elevatus to a comma. I have reproduced the manuscript punctuation, making minor corrections while reproducing the original forms, as it better communicates the text in certain passages.

Blair's variants between Life A and its various adaptations are selective, functioning as documentation for his emendations rather than a full collation between these sources, as this would have been ungainly. This also, however, makes it difficult to objectively reproduce these variants, as most reflect medieval revision rather than a direct textual tradition. The apparatus therefore notes only where it draws on Blair's emendations along with his source, and where it differs from his edition.
