title: Vita sancte Frideswide, A (BHL 3164)
subtitle: Introduction
---

This is the oldest substantial life of Frideswide, written by an unknown writer in the early twelfth century. John Blair designates it 'Life A', and the adaptation that he attributes to Robert of Cricklade as 'Life B' [@blair:1987saint, p. 93].

# Manuscript: London, British Library, Cotton MS Nero E. i/2

The complete Life A is known in only one manuscript: London, British Library, Cotton MS Nero E. i/2, fols 156r--157v (*N*), part of the 'Cotton-Corpus Legendary', originally made at Worcester in the third quarter of the eleventh century [@ker:1957catalogue, no. 29: the British Library replaced the 'part 1' and 'part 2' notations in the shelfmark with '/1' and '/2' in 2017]. This is the oldest substantial collection of saints' lives from England, now spread across Cotton MS Nero E. i/1, Nero E. i/2, and Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 9. The contents have been rearranged over time and additions made to them. In their original form, the set consisted of two volumes, with the lives arranged from January through December [@jackson:1996contents].

The section containing the life of Frideswide is part of a set of additions from the second quarter of the twelfth century: in Nero E. i/1, fols 53v--54v; and in Nero E. i/1, fols 156--165 and 187--188, adding new folios to the volume:

Nero E. i/1, fols 53v--54v
: *Passio sancti Andree* (BHL 000)<!-- chk -->

Nero E. i/2, fols 156r--157v
: *Vita sancte Fritheswithe uirginis* (BHL 3164)

Nero E. i/2, fols 158r--162v
: Rhygyfarch ap Sulien, *Vita beati Dauidis episcopi* (BHL 2107) [@james:1967rhigyfarchs]

Nero E. i/2, fols 162v--165r
: Ps.-Theophimus, *Vita sancte Margarete Antiochie* (BHL 5303)<!-- chk: Blair says 5303--5305? -->

Nero E. i/2, fol. 165v
: Blank with pen trials, possibly once at the end of the manuscript

Nero E. i/2, fols 187r--188v
: *Vita Bede* (BHL 1069)

Patrick McGurk identifies the additions as being in the hand of John of Worcester (*fl.* 1095--1140). An inscription in his chronicle from Worcester Cathedral Priory (Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 157) identifies it as being his autograph. The same hand also appears in Dublin, Trinity College, MS 503; Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Auct. F. 1. 9; and Cambridge, University Library, MS Kk.4.6 [@darlington:1995chronicle, pp. 2:xix--xxix<!-- chk -->; @jackson:1996contents, pp. 144--145; @thomson:2011descriptive, pp. 82--83 and plates 5 a--e]. They are not fragments from another book: Nero E. i/1, fols 53v--54v are an addition to originally blank pages from the eleventh century. A fragment of a pen trial on Nero E. i/2, fol. 165v, 'dei gratia Wigo', confirms that the pages were at Worcester [@blair:1987saint, p. 93]. Cotton and his associates have intervened in the contents after fol. 165: fols 181--84 were not in the volume when it was owned by John Joscelyn [@tite:2003early, p. 138].

Frideswide's life is divided in the manuscript into ten apparent chapters, designated through two- to three-line capitals in red. Apart from the opening rubric, there are no headings or other markers to indicate whether they reflected a liturgical purpose or intellectual scheme.

# Editorial method

The text is edited from the single complete manuscript. It was last edited by @blair:1987saint, who aimed to understand more of its textual tradition through comparison with various derivative versions produced up to the sixteenth century. These are:

- an abbreviation of the text (BHL 3166) in the fourteenth-century Romsey Legendary (*L*: London, British Library, Lansdowne MS 436, fols 101r--103r);
- a brief summary (BHL 3167) in a miscellany from the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century (*B*: Oxford, Balliol College, MS 228, fol. 300r);
- extracts in the Hereford breviary, as edited from three sources (*H*: Hereford, Cathedral Library, MS P.9.vi; *W*: Worcester, Cathedral Library, MS Q.86; and *R*: the Rouen printing of 1505) [@frere:1904hereford, p. 2:376--377].

This yielded several emendations to the text. Blair concluded that *L* and *B* were likely derived from a separate exemplar than *N* and Life B, though identifying these variants required extensive editorial judgement. He created section numbers, reproduced here, to facilitate comparison between this life and Robert of Cricklade's.

This new edition presents Life A along much the same lines as Blair. I created a new transcription of the text using the images available online from the British Library, and collated the result with Blair's edition to reduce error. This brought to light two minor misreadings of *N* in the previous edition. Blair's punctuation is based on the manuscript's, mostly changing any instance of a point or punctus elevatus to a comma. I have reproduced the manuscript punctuation more transparently, making only minor corrections while reproducing the original forms, as it better communicates the text in certain passages.

Blair's variants between Life A and its various adaptations are selective, and function as documentation for his emendations rather than a full collation between these sources, as this would have been ungainly. This also, however, makes it difficult to objectively reproduce these variants, as most reflect medieval revision rather than a direct textual tradition. The apparatus therefore notes only where it draws on Blair's emendations along with his source, and where it differs from his edition. Further study of the Romsey Legendary demonstrates that it makes many original rhetorical flourishes to its sources, which prompts a more conservative treatment than Blair gives it. I have omitted several of Blair's emendations on this basis, adopting its readings only where the sense demands them.
