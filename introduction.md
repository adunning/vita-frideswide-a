title: Vita sancte Frideswide, A (BHL 3164)
subtitle: Introduction
---

This is the oldest substantial life of Frideswide, written by an unknown writer in the early twelfth century. John Blair designates it 'Life A', and the adaptation that he attributes to Robert of Cricklade as 'Life B' [@blair:1987saint, p. 93].

# Manuscript: London, British Library, Cotton MS Nero E. i/2

The complete Life A is known in only one manuscript: London, British Library, Cotton MS Nero E. i/2, fols 156r--157v (*N*), part of the 'Cotton-Corpus Legendary', originally made at Worcester in the eleventh century. This is the oldest multi-volume collection of saints' lives from England, spread across the two parts of Cotton MS Nero E. i and Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 9 [@jackson:1996contents].

The section containing the life of Frideswide is part of an addition from the twelfth century:

fols 156r--157v
: *Vita sancte Fritheswithe uirginis* (BHL 3164)

fols 158r--162v
: Rhygyfarch ap Sulien, *Vita beati Dauidis episcopi* (BHL 2107, Nero recension)

fols 162v--165r
: Ps.-Theophimus, *Vita sancte Margarete Antiochie* (BHL 5303)

fols 166r--167r
: Adrevald of Fleury, *Aduentus et exceptio sancti Benedicti et Scholastice* (BHL 1117, imperfect)

fols 167r--168r
: *Exaltatio sancte crucis* (cf. BHL 4178)

fols 168r--180r
: *Actus sancti Siluestri pape* (BHL 7739)

fol. 180r--v
: *Passio sancte Columbe* (BHL 1893)

fols 187r--188v
: *Vita Bede* (BHL 1069)

Frideswide's life is divided in the manuscript into ten apparent chapters, designated through two- to three-line capitals in red. Apart from the opening rubric, there are no headings or other markers to indicate whether they reflected a liturgical purpose or intellectual scheme.

# Editorial method

The text is edited from the single complete manuscript. It was last edited by @blair:1987saint, who aimed to understand more of its textual tradition through comparison with various derivative versions produced up to the sixteenth century. These are:

- an abbreviation of the text (BHL 3166) in the fourteenth-century Romsey Legendary (*L*: London, British Library, Lansdowne MS 436, fols 101r--103r);
- a brief summary (BHL 3167) in a miscellany from the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century (*B*: Oxford, Balliol College, MS 228, fol. 300r);
- extracts in the Hereford breviary, as edited from three sources (*H*: Hereford, Cathedral Library, MS P.9.vi; *W*: Worcester, Cathedral Library, MS Q.86; and *R*: the Rouen printing of 1505) [@frere:1904hereford, p. 2:376--377].

This yielded several emendations to the text. Blair concluded that *L* and *B* were likely derived from a separate exemplar than *N* and Life B, though identifying these variants required extensive editorial judgement. He created section numbers, reproduced here, to facilitate comparison between this life and Robert of Cricklade's.

This new edition presents Life A along much the same lines as Blair. I created a new transcription of the text using the images available online from the British Library, and collated the result with Blair's edition to reduce error. This brought to light two minor misreadings of *N* in the previous edition. Blair's punctuation is based on the manuscript's, mostly changing any instance of a point or punctus elevatus to a comma. I have reproduced the manuscript punctuation more transparently, making only minor corrections while reproducing the original forms, as it better communicates the text in certain passages.

Blair's variants between Life A and its various adaptations are selective, and function as documentation for his emendations rather than a full collation between these sources, as this would have been ungainly. This also, however, makes it difficult to objectively reproduce these variants, as most reflect medieval revision rather than a direct textual tradition. The apparatus therefore notes only where it draws on Blair's emendations along with his source, and where it differs from his edition. Further study of the Romsey Legendary demonstrates that it makes many original rhetorical flourishes to its sources, which prompts a more conservative treatment than Blair gives it. I have omitted several of Blair's emendations on this basis, adopting its readings only where the sense demands them.
